    question: "What inspired you to become a developer?",
    p1: "I have always been deeply interested in technology, having had access to the latest tech gadgets since childhood. This early exposure nurtured my passion for understanding and creating with technology. Although I initially pursued a degree in Biology, I realized it wasn’t my true calling. My mentor, Jhonatan Lopez, recognizing my love for tech, advised me to explore software engineering. After thorough research, I decided to transition to this field, and my time at Holberton Coding Bootcamp quickly affirmed that coding was my true passion.",
    p2: 'As a self-taught developer, I faced the significant challenge of dedicating time to study and overcoming the fear of "will I make it." By committing to a daily routine of learning and creating small projects, I built my skills and confidence. My motivation comes from a desire to master various aspects of software engineering and to be competitive in the tech industry. I aim to become a full-stack developer and explore emerging fields like AI. The joy of seeing my hard work come to life and function as intended is immensely rewarding and drives my continuous learning and development.',

    question:
      "How do you stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in web development?",
    p1: 'I stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in web development primarily through social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. I follow numerous tech-savvy influencers such as TiffinTech, MKBHD, and ThePrimeagen, who share insights, opinions, and highlights on various aspects of the tech industry, from hardware to software advancements. Additionally, I am active in several online communities focused on programming, including the Facebook group "Programadores de Puerto Rico" and Discord forums like Codecademy and Little Software Planet, where I engage in discussions and exchange knowledge with other developers.',
    p2: "For continuous learning, I utilize platforms like Codecademy, GeeksForGeeks, and W3Schools, supplemented by YouTube videos for reinforcement. After learning new technologies, I like to create small, random projects to practice and solidify my understanding. Although I haven't yet attended major conferences and meetups, it is my next step and a goal I am looking forward to achieving in the near future to further immerse myself in the software engineering community.",

    question: "Can you describe your workflow when starting a new project?",
    p1: "Before starting a new project, I assess its feasibility based on my current knowledge and define the tech stack I plan to use. I then create a wireframe to outline the structure and decide the order of tasks. With a clear idea in mind, I proceed to create a mockup to visualize the desired look of the project. I choose the technologies and tools by balancing the project’s requirements with my comfort level and familiarity with different options. If the project is inspired by an existing one, I study various versions to gather ideas and determine where I can implement unique features.",
    p2: "During development, I manage version control using Git and GitHub to ensure efficient collaboration and code management. Although I am still enhancing my testing and debugging skills, I have experience using Jest and Mocha for these purposes. For deployment, I use platforms like Netlify and Vercel. My workflow doesn’t end with deployment; I continuously monitor and seek ways to improve the application, ensuring it remains functional and up-to-date with the latest advancements."
